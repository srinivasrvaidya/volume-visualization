\chapter{Appendix: How to Add an Appendix}\label{apdx:a}

This is Appendix~\ref{apdx:a}.

You can have additional appendices too, (\emph{e.g.}, \texttt{apdxb.tex},
\texttt{apdxc.tex}, \emph{etc.}). These files need to be included in
\texttt{thesis.tex}.

If you don't need any appendices, delete the appendix
related lines from \texttt{thesis.tex}.
