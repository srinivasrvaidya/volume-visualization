  year =       "2006",
  abstract =   "Exploded views are an illustration technique where an object
               is partitioned into several segments. These segments are
               displaced to reveal otherwise hidden detail. In this paper
               we apply the concept of exploded views to volumetric data in
               order to solve the general problem of occlusion. In many
               cases an object of interest is occluded by other structures.
               While transparency or cutaways can be used to reveal a focus
               object, these techniques remove parts of the context
               information. Exploded views, on the other hand, do not
               suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a
               force-based model: the volume is divided into a part
               configuration controlled by a number of forces and
               constraints. The focus object exerts an explosion force
               causing the parts to arrange according to the given
               constraints. We show that this novel and flexible approach
               allows for a wide variety of explosion-based visualizations
               including view-dependent explosions. Furthermore, we present
               a high-quality GPU-based volume ray casting algorithm for
               exploded views which allows rendering and interaction at
               several frames per second.",

  abstract =   "This paper presents importance-driven feature enhancement as
               a technique for the automatic generation of cut-away and
               ghosted views out of volumetric data. The presented
               focus+context approach removes or suppresses less important
               parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying
               information. however, less important parts are fully visible
               in those regions, where important visual information is not
               lost, i.e., more relevant features are not occluded.
               Features within the volumetric data are first classified
               according to a new dimension denoted as object importance.
               This property determines which structures should be readily
               discernible and which structures are less important. Next,
               for each feature various representations (levels of
               sparseness) from a dense to a sparse depiction are defined.
               Levels of sparseness define a spectrum of optical properties
               or rendering styles. The resulting image is generated by
               ray-casting and combining the intersected features
               proportional to their importance (importance compositing).
               The paper includes an extended discussion on several
               possible schemes for levels of sparseness specification.
               Furthermore different approaches to importance compositing
               are treated.",
