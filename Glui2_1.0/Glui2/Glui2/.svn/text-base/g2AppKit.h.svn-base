 File: g2AppKit.mm/h
 Desc: Objective-C specific App Kit based API callbacks. It
 is necessary to split this code into a separate h/m pair
 to access the OS-level (in ObjC) open/save panels.
 
 Note that the *.mm extension to the implementation file is
 critical as it tells the compiler it is a mix of C, C++,
 and Objective-C (so we can have C-style global functions yet
 includes Objective-C AppKit function calls).
 
 OutBuffer will be written to as much as possible.
 
 Results are based on true: success, false: failure
