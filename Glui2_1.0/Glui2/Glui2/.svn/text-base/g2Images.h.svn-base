 File: g2Images.cpp/h
 Desc: C-Style image loading and saving functions. Based on
 interfacing with stb_image from author Sean Barrett and his
 published code on http://nothings.org/
 
 Loads all of the following formats: (based on stb_images)
 
 JPEG baseline (no JPEG progressive)
 PNG 8-bit only
 
 TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
 BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
 PSD (composited view only, no extra channels)
 
 GIF (*comp always reports as 4-channel)
 HDR (radiance rgbE format)
 PIC (Softimage PIC)
